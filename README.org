* brand-share

In a product market or stock market, different products or stocks
compete for the same consumers or purchasers. We propose a method to
estimate the time-varying transition matrix of the product share using
a multivariate time series of the product share. The method is based
on the assumption that each of the observed time series of shares is a
stationary dis- tribution of the underlying Markov processes
characterized by transition probability matrices. We estimate
transition probability matrices for every observation under natural
assumptions. We demonstrate, on a real-world dataset of the share of
automobiles, that the proposed method can find intrinsic transition of
shares.
